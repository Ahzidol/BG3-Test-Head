Make sure you keep your folder structure looking like this, but I will make a note whenever the structure can be changed.

GO INTO EACH FOLDER AND READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, MAKE SURE YOU EDIT EVERY FILE ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS.

In each folder structure I'll include instructions on what to do with the files. You will need:

- An advanced text document editor, such as notepad++ or vscode (https://notepad-plus-plus.org) (https://code.visualstudio.com)
- LSLIB and Modders Multitool (https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) (https://github.com/ShinyHobo/BG3-Modders-Multitool)
- Blender, and the GR2 plugin for it, for editing your head mesh (https://www.blender.org) (https://github.com/Norbyte/dos2de_collada_exporter)
- GIMP or Photoshop + DDS plugin (https://www.gimp.org) (https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) (https://code.google.com/archive/p/gimp-dds/downloads) (https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter)
